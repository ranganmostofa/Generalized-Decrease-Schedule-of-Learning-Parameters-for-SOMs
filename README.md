# Generalized-Decrease-Schedule-of-Learning-Parameters-for-SOMs
We aim to boost the convergence speed of self-organizing maps by 
generalizing the decrease schedules of learning rates and 
neighborhood radii using statistically efficient metrics such 
as the map embedding and topographic accuracies.
